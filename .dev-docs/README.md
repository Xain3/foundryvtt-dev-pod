# .dev-docs

This directory contains development documentation that is actively consumed **for** and **while** creating code. It serves as a workspace for documents that directly support the coding process.

## Contents

- **Specs**: Detailed specifications for features, components, or systems being developed.
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements documents.
- **Tasks**: Task lists, TODOs, and development checklists.
- **PR Messages**: Drafts and templates for pull request descriptions and commit messages.

## Purpose

Unlike the `docs/` directory, which contains high-level guidelines and process documentation that serve as references but are not typically used during the actual writing of code, this directory holds working documents that are referenced and updated throughout the development cycle.

These documents are meant to be:

- **Active**: Updated as code evolves
- **Contextual**: Directly related to current development work
- **Temporary**: May be moved, archived, or cleaned up after completion

## Structure

- `.specs/`: Formal specifications and design documents
- `local/`: Local development notes and environment-specific docs
- `.tmp/`: Temporary files and drafts (see `.tmp/README.md` for details)
