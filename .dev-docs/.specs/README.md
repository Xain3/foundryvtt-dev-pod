# .specs

Purpose

- Temporary development guidelines, design notes, and experimental specs.
- Intended as workspace-local documentation used during active development.

Visibility & syncing

- By default `.specs` is not intended for long-term or public documentation.
- Put files you want to keep out of git in `.specs/local/` and add that path to `.gitignore`.

Usage

- Use this folder for draft architecture notes, runnable snippets, and quick how-tos.
- When something matures, move it into the main `docs/` or project README and remove it from `.specs`.

Maintenance

- Keep contents concise and ephemeral; prune regularly to avoid stale guidance.
