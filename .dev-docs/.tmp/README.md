# .tmp

This is a temporary directory within `.dev-docs` for transient development documentation files.

## Purpose

- **Drafts**: Work-in-progress documents that haven't been finalized
- **Scratch Notes**: Temporary notes, ideas, or brainstorming content
- **Intermediate Files**: Files generated during development that may be discarded later
- **Backup Copies**: Temporary backups of documents being edited

## Guidelines

- Files in this directory are not permanent and may be cleaned up at any time
- Use descriptive filenames to identify the content
- Move finalized documents to appropriate locations in `.dev-docs` or parent directories
- This directory is ignored by version control (typically via `.gitignore`)

## Maintenance

Regularly review and clean up outdated or unnecessary files to keep the workspace organized.
