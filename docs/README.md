# docs/

This directory contains reference documentation, high-level guidelines, and process documentation that serve as authoritative sources for project standards and procedures.

## Purpose

Unlike the `.dev-docs/` directory, which contains active working documents consumed during the coding process, this directory holds:

- **Guidelines**: Coding standards, style guides, and best practices
- **Process Documentation**: CI/CD workflows, testing procedures, and development workflows
- **Reference Materials**: Specifications, architecture docs, and technical documentation
- **Standards**: Code style, coverage requirements, and quality gates

## Usage

These documents are primarily used as **references** rather than being actively edited during development:

- Consult during code reviews to ensure compliance with standards
- Reference when setting up development environments or CI pipelines
- Use as templates or examples for new projects or features
- Review periodically to stay updated on project conventions

## Contents

- `ci-and-coverage.md`: Continuous integration and test coverage guidelines
- `code-style.md`: Code style and formatting standards

## Maintenance

- Update when project standards evolve
- Keep current with tool versions and best practices
- Archive outdated documents rather than deleting them
- Cross-reference with `.dev-docs/` for implementation-specific details
